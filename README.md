# Simple custom generation of TubeMaps 

Adapted from [vgteam](https://github.com/vgteam/sequenceTubeMap)

## Usage

Install the project as a node JS package: git clone this project, then `npm init` and `npm install`.

Follow the syntax in src/index.js to specify the tube map graph. 

Then run ./webpack_update and dist/tubemap.html will contain the graph. src/index.js is the target file which contains the graph specification.
